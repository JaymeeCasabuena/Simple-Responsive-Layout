        <p>Dear YOU, I hope that you find something that brings you joy later in life so much so that you willingly help others experience that joy as well. 
          I won’t stop doing things that bring me joy just because you’re having a meltdown about a pointless chart on a forum.</p>

      <p>I can’t even type. Still shaking with anger. Breathes… Ok, friends, let’s end this week strong and be ready to STREAM and BUY into a repeak with the new remix.
